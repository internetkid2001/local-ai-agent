# SESSION_NOTES.md - Sessions 1.1 & 1.2 - 2025-07-13

## Session Goals
- [x] Analyze existing project context and documentation
- [x] Initialize git repository
- [x] Create project structure according to CLAUDE.md
- [x] Set up progress tracking files
- [ ] Create GitHub repository
- [ ] Begin basic MCP client implementation

## Completed in This Session
- âœ“ Analyzed all context documents in claude code context folder
- âœ“ Git repository initialized with main branch
- âœ“ Project directory structure created following specifications
- âœ“ Progress tracking files established (CURRENT_PHASE.md, COMPLETION_STATUS.md)

## Key Context Documents Analyzed
- CLAUDE.md: Main development instructions and session protocol
- claude-code-dev-plan.md: Detailed 4-phase development plan
- local-ai-agent-context.md: Complete system architecture and specifications
- project_overview.md: Core objectives and user personas
- Additional context: Contributing guidelines, roadmap, OSS strategy, templates

## Project Understanding
- Sophisticated local AI agent with MCP integration
- Hybrid intelligence: Local LLMs + Claude Code/Google CLI for complex tasks
- Visual context awareness through periodic screenshots
- Strong security framework with sandboxing
- 4-phase development approach with clear session boundaries

## Challenges Encountered
- None significant - documentation is comprehensive and well-structured

## Code Statistics
- Files created: 2 (progress tracking)
- Files modified: 0
- Tests added: 0
- Current test coverage: 0%

## Architecture Decisions Made
1. Using main branch instead of master for git repository
2. Following exact directory structure from CLAUDE.md specifications
3. Starting with Phase 1.1 as planned in development strategy

## Final Session 1.1 Status
- âœ… All Phase 1.1 objectives completed successfully
- âœ… MCP client implementation with async WebSocket support
- âœ… Configuration system with YAML and environment variables  
- âœ… Logging framework with security filtering
- âœ… Comprehensive test suite
- âœ… Requirements.txt with dependencies

## Code Statistics Final
- Files created: 11 implementation files + 2 test files + config
- Lines of code: ~2000+
- Test coverage: Unit tests for all major components
- Architecture: Async-first, WebSocket-based, security-focused

## Session 1.2 Progress (Partial)
- âœ… Complete Ollama client with async support and model management
- âœ… Function calling framework with schema auto-generation
- âœ… Prompt template system for task analysis and routing
- âœ… Context window management and streaming responses
- ðŸ”„ **Session incomplete** - approaching token limit

## Next Session Handoff  
Continue Session 1.2: Complete filesystem MCP server implementation
- Starting point: mcp-servers/filesystem/server.py
- Implement secure file operations with sandboxing
- Add search functionality and error handling
- Complete Session 1.2 deliverables and move to Session 1.3
