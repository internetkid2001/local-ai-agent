# SESSION_NOTES.md - Sessions 1.1 & 1.2 - 2025-07-13

## Session Goals
- [x] Analyze existing project context and documentation
- [x] Initialize git repository
- [x] Create project structure according to CLAUDE.md
- [x] Set up progress tracking files
- [ ] Create GitHub repository
- [ ] Begin basic MCP client implementation

## Completed in This Session
- ✓ Analyzed all context documents in claude code context folder
- ✓ Git repository initialized with main branch
- ✓ Project directory structure created following specifications
- ✓ Progress tracking files established (CURRENT_PHASE.md, COMPLETION_STATUS.md)

## Key Context Documents Analyzed
- CLAUDE.md: Main development instructions and session protocol
- claude-code-dev-plan.md: Detailed 4-phase development plan
- local-ai-agent-context.md: Complete system architecture and specifications
- project_overview.md: Core objectives and user personas
- Additional context: Contributing guidelines, roadmap, OSS strategy, templates

## Project Understanding
- Sophisticated local AI agent with MCP integration
- Hybrid intelligence: Local LLMs + Claude Code/Google CLI for complex tasks
- Visual context awareness through periodic screenshots
- Strong security framework with sandboxing
- 4-phase development approach with clear session boundaries

## Challenges Encountered
- None significant - documentation is comprehensive and well-structured

## Code Statistics
- Files created: 2 (progress tracking)
- Files modified: 0
- Tests added: 0
- Current test coverage: 0%

## Architecture Decisions Made
1. Using main branch instead of master for git repository
2. Following exact directory structure from CLAUDE.md specifications
3. Starting with Phase 1.1 as planned in development strategy

## Final Session 1.1 Status
- ✅ All Phase 1.1 objectives completed successfully
- ✅ MCP client implementation with async WebSocket support
- ✅ Configuration system with YAML and environment variables  
- ✅ Logging framework with security filtering
- ✅ Comprehensive test suite
- ✅ Requirements.txt with dependencies

## Code Statistics Final
- Files created: 11 implementation files + 2 test files + config
- Lines of code: ~2000+
- Test coverage: Unit tests for all major components
- Architecture: Async-first, WebSocket-based, security-focused

## Session 1.2 Progress (COMPLETED)
- ✅ Complete Ollama client with async support and model management
- ✅ Function calling framework with schema auto-generation
- ✅ Prompt template system for task analysis and routing
- ✅ Context window management and streaming responses
- ✅ Complete filesystem MCP server implementation
- ✅ Secure file operations with comprehensive sandboxing
- ✅ Search functionality and robust error handling
- ✅ Full test suite with core functionality verification

## Session 1.2 Final Status
- ✅ **Session 1.2 COMPLETED successfully**
- ✅ Filesystem MCP server with 9 core tools implemented
- ✅ Security framework with path validation and sandboxing
- ✅ WebSocket MCP protocol server implementation
- ✅ Comprehensive test suite passing all functionality tests
- ✅ Configuration system with YAML support
- ✅ Complete documentation and README

## Code Statistics Session 1.2
- Files created: 6 new filesystem MCP server files
- Lines of code: ~1000+ (filesystem server)
- Test coverage: Core functionality 100% tested
- Features: 9 MCP tools, security sandboxing, search capabilities

## Ready for Session 1.3
Next session should begin Phase 1.3: Integration and Advanced Features
- Integrate filesystem MCP server with main agent
- Implement agent task routing and decision engine
- Add screenshot context capabilities
- Begin advanced AI integration framework

# Current Session Notes - 2025-07-13

## Project State Confirmation
- Confirmed that Phases 1, 2, and 3 are completed as per `HANDOFF_INSTRUCTIONS.md`.
- The project is currently in **Phase 4: Enterprise Integration & Deployment**.
- Discovered that the **Enterprise Authentication System** (Priority 1 for Phase 4) has already been substantially implemented.

## Existing Authentication Components Found:
- `src/agent/enterprise/auth/__init__.py`
- `src/agent/enterprise/auth/auth_system.py`: Appears to be the main entry point for the auth system, integrating JWT, RBAC, and Tenant Managers. Includes a default admin setup.
- `src/agent/enterprise/auth/endpoints.py`: Defines FastAPI routes for login, refresh, user management (create, get, list, update, delete), with RBAC and multi-tenancy checks.
- `src/agent/enterprise/auth/jwt_manager.py`: Handles JWT token creation, verification, and password hashing/verification using `passlib`.
- `src/agent/enterprise/auth/middleware.py`: Provides FastAPI dependencies for authentication, permission checking (`require_permission`), role checking (`require_roles`), and tenant access.
- `src/agent/enterprise/auth/rbac.py`: Implements Role-Based Access Control with `Role`, `User` dataclasses, and `RBACManager` for managing roles, users, and permissions. Defines `Resource` and `Permission` enums.
- `src/agent/enterprise/auth/tenant_manager.py`: Manages tenants, including creation, retrieval, user assignment, and feature access checks.

## Next Steps Identified:
- The next logical step is to integrate this existing authentication system into the main FastAPI application, as outlined in "Priority 3: API Gateway Foundation" in `HANDOFF_INSTRUCTIONS.md`. This involves setting up `src/agent/api/main.py` and including the authentication router.
