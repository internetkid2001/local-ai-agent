# SESSION_NOTES.md - Session 1.1 - 2025-07-13

## Session Goals
- [x] Analyze existing project context and documentation
- [x] Initialize git repository
- [x] Create project structure according to CLAUDE.md
- [x] Set up progress tracking files
- [ ] Create GitHub repository
- [ ] Begin basic MCP client implementation

## Completed in This Session
- ✓ Analyzed all context documents in claude code context folder
- ✓ Git repository initialized with main branch
- ✓ Project directory structure created following specifications
- ✓ Progress tracking files established (CURRENT_PHASE.md, COMPLETION_STATUS.md)

## Key Context Documents Analyzed
- CLAUDE.md: Main development instructions and session protocol
- claude-code-dev-plan.md: Detailed 4-phase development plan
- local-ai-agent-context.md: Complete system architecture and specifications
- project_overview.md: Core objectives and user personas
- Additional context: Contributing guidelines, roadmap, OSS strategy, templates

## Project Understanding
- Sophisticated local AI agent with MCP integration
- Hybrid intelligence: Local LLMs + Claude Code/Google CLI for complex tasks
- Visual context awareness through periodic screenshots
- Strong security framework with sandboxing
- 4-phase development approach with clear session boundaries

## Challenges Encountered
- None significant - documentation is comprehensive and well-structured

## Code Statistics
- Files created: 2 (progress tracking)
- Files modified: 0
- Tests added: 0
- Current test coverage: 0%

## Architecture Decisions Made
1. Using main branch instead of master for git repository
2. Following exact directory structure from CLAUDE.md specifications
3. Starting with Phase 1.1 as planned in development strategy

## Next Session Setup
Starting point: Begin MCP client implementation in src/mcp_client/
Context needed: MCP protocol specifications and async connection patterns
Dependencies: Need to set up Python environment and install MCP dependencies
