# NEXT_STEPS.md

## Immediate Next Steps
1. **Integrate Existing Authentication System into Main FastAPI Application**
   - Create `src/agent/api/main.py`.
   - Include the authentication router from `src/agent/enterprise/auth/endpoints.py`.
   - Add a simple, authenticated endpoint to `main.py` for verification.

## Context for Next Session
- **Current State:** Phase 4, Enterprise Authentication System is substantially implemented.
- **Confirmed:** The user has successfully run and started the program on their machine in previous sessions.
- **Next Priority:** Setting up the API Gateway Foundation by integrating the existing authentication system.

## Files to Review for Next Session
- `src/agent/enterprise/auth/auth_system.py`
- `src/agent/enterprise/auth/endpoints.py`
- `src/agent/enterprise/auth/jwt_manager.py`
- `src/agent/enterprise/auth/middleware.py`
- `src/agent/enterprise/auth/rbac.py`
- `src/agent/enterprise/auth/tenant_manager.py`
- `src/agent/api/main.py` (to be created)

## Environment State
- All necessary dependencies for FastAPI, JWT, and password hashing are assumed to be installed (e.g., `fastapi`, `uvicorn`, `python-jose[cryptography]`, `passlib[bcrypt]`, `python-multipart`).

**End of Session Handoff. Ready to continue with API Gateway Foundation.**
