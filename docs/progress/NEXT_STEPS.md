# NEXT_STEPS.md

## Immediate Next Steps
1. Complete Session 1.2: Implement filesystem MCP server
2. Create secure file operations with sandboxing
3. Add search functionality and error handling
4. Begin Session 1.3: File System MCP Server testing and integration

## Context for Next Session  
- Current state: Phase 1.1 complete, Session 1.2 Ollama integration ~80% complete
- Key decisions made:
  - Async-first architecture for MCP client and Ollama integration
  - Function calling with automatic schema generation from Python functions
  - Comprehensive prompt template system for task analysis and routing
  - Multi-model support with health checking and automatic fallbacks
  - Context window management with intelligent message truncation
- No blocking issues identified

## Files to Review First
1. src/agent/llm/ollama_client.py - Complete Ollama integration with function calling
2. src/agent/llm/function_calling.py - Function calling framework with auto-schema generation  
3. src/agent/llm/prompt_templates.py - Task analysis and routing prompt templates
4. src/mcp_client/base_client.py - Core MCP client implementation
5. docs/progress/SESSION_NOTES.md - Current session progress and context
6. claude-me-file.md - Full project development instructions

## Environment State
- Branch: dev-phase-1
- Last commit: [to be updated after commit]
- Tests created: MCP client and configuration tests
- All Phase 1.1 deliverables complete

## Session 1.1 Summary
‚úÖ **Completed:**
- Complete MCP client architecture with async WebSocket support
- Connection pooling and retry logic with exponential backoff
- Tool discovery and execution framework
- Comprehensive configuration system with YAML and environment variables
- Structured logging with security filtering and component-specific levels
- Security framework with path validation and permission checking
- Full test suite with unit tests and mocks
- Requirements.txt with all necessary dependencies

üìä **Code Statistics:**
- Files created: 11 core implementation files
- Test files: 2 comprehensive test suites  
- Configuration files: 1 main config + requirements
- Total lines of code: ~2000+

üèóÔ∏è **Architecture Decisions:**
- AsyncIO-based MCP client for high performance
- WebSocket communication with automatic reconnection
- Component-based security with sandboxing
- Dot-notation configuration access
- Colored console logging with file rotation

## Ready for Session 1.2
Next session should begin with Ollama integration:
- Implement `src/agent/llm/ollama_client.py`
- Add function calling support for local LLM
- Create prompt templates for task analysis
- Begin basic filesystem MCP server implementation
