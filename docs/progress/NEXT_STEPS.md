# NEXT_STEPS.md

## Immediate Next Steps
1. Continue with Session 1.2: Ollama Integration
2. Implement Ollama client wrapper with function calling support
3. Create prompt templates for task analysis
4. Test MCP client with basic filesystem server

## Context for Next Session
- Current state: Phase 1.1 Basic MCP Client implementation complete
- Key decisions made: 
  - Async-first architecture for MCP client
  - WebSocket-based communication with retry logic
  - Comprehensive security framework with path validation
  - Structured logging with component-specific levels
- No blocking issues identified

## Files to Review First
1. src/mcp_client/base_client.py - Core MCP client implementation
2. src/mcp_client/connection.py - Connection management with retry logic
3. src/utils/config.py - Configuration system with YAML and env vars
4. src/utils/logger.py - Logging framework with security filtering
5. config/agent_config.yaml - Main configuration file
6. tests/test_mcp_client.py - Comprehensive test suite

## Environment State
- Branch: dev-phase-1
- Last commit: [to be updated after commit]
- Tests created: MCP client and configuration tests
- All Phase 1.1 deliverables complete

## Session 1.1 Summary
‚úÖ **Completed:**
- Complete MCP client architecture with async WebSocket support
- Connection pooling and retry logic with exponential backoff
- Tool discovery and execution framework
- Comprehensive configuration system with YAML and environment variables
- Structured logging with security filtering and component-specific levels
- Security framework with path validation and permission checking
- Full test suite with unit tests and mocks
- Requirements.txt with all necessary dependencies

üìä **Code Statistics:**
- Files created: 11 core implementation files
- Test files: 2 comprehensive test suites  
- Configuration files: 1 main config + requirements
- Total lines of code: ~2000+

üèóÔ∏è **Architecture Decisions:**
- AsyncIO-based MCP client for high performance
- WebSocket communication with automatic reconnection
- Component-based security with sandboxing
- Dot-notation configuration access
- Colored console logging with file rotation

## Ready for Session 1.2
Next session should begin with Ollama integration:
- Implement `src/agent/llm/ollama_client.py`
- Add function calling support for local LLM
- Create prompt templates for task analysis
- Begin basic filesystem MCP server implementation
