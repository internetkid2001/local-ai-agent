## Project Continuation Notes

**Date:** July 13, 2025 8:20pm

**Current Status:**
We are continuing Phase 4: Enterprise Integration & Deployment, specifically focusing on UI enhancements. The goal is to make the UI more like "Cluely AI" (minimalistic, floating overlay) and function as both a web and desktop application.

**Last Action Performed:**
Modified `src/agent/ui/webapp.py` to serve the React build directory directly from the root (`/`) using `app.mount("/", StaticFiles(directory=react_build_dir, html=True), name="react_app")`.

**Problems Encountered (RESOLVED):**
1.  **✅ UI Not Draggable:** FIXED - Issue was with mouse event handling. React component had onMouseMove only triggered when mouse was over the element. Solution: Added document-level event listeners and used useCallback for performance.

2.  **✅ WebSocket Connection Errors:** FIXED - Issue was with route mounting order. Static files were mounted at "/" before API routes, causing conflicts. Solution: Added CORS middleware and reordered routes (static files now mounted last).

**Completed in Session 4.5:**
1.  **✅ Fixed Draggable UI:** Implemented proper mouse event handling with document-level listeners
2.  **✅ Fixed WebSocket Connection:** Added CORS support and corrected route mounting order  
3.  **✅ Created Authentication Integration:** Built src/agent/api/main.py with enterprise auth system
4.  **✅ Enhanced UI Performance:** Added useCallback optimization for event handlers

**Current Status:**
- React UI with draggable chat interface is fully functional
- WebSocket real-time communication is working
- Enterprise authentication system is integrated into main API
- Both standalone webapp.py and integrated main.py are available
- Simple test environment (simple_ui_test.py) working perfectly

**Testing Instructions:**
Run `python3 simple_ui_test.py` then open http://localhost:8080
The mock AI will respond to your prompts and ask for further development instructions.

**Ready for Next Session:**
All Phase 4.5 objectives completed. Ready for performance optimization and advanced features.








Providing the right documentation is crucial for addressing the issues you're facing and guiding your implementation towards the "Cluely AI" UI vision. Here's a curated set of documentation and resources, categorized by your current challenges and goals:

### 1. Draggable UI in React (Problem 1)

Your `App.js` already contains logic for dragging, but it's not functioning. This could be due to CSS conflicts, incorrect event handling, or missing library dependencies.

* **React-Draggable Library (Recommended for Simplicity):**
    * **NPM Page:** [https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-draggable](https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-draggable)
    * **Why it helps:** This library simplifies making components draggable. It handles event listeners, positioning, and performance efficiently. Your current manual JavaScript logic might be clashing with React's rendering cycle or default browser behaviors. Using a well-maintained library often resolves subtle issues.
    * **Key aspects to review:**
        * Basic usage: Wrapping your component with `<Draggable>`.
        * `handle` prop: If only a specific part of your UI should initiate the drag (e.g., a header bar), use this to define the draggable handle.
        * `position` vs. `defaultPosition`: Understand how to control the position (controlled vs. uncontrolled component).
        * `onStart`, `onDrag`, `onStop` callbacks: For integrating with your component's state or other logic.
* **React DnD (for Complex Drag-and-Drop, if needed later):**
    * **Website:** [https://react-dnd.github.io/react-dnd/](https://react-dnd.github.io/react-dnd/)
    * **Why it helps:** While `react-draggable` is ideal for a single draggable element, if you envision more complex drag-and-drop interactions (e.g., reordering items, dropping onto specific targets), `react-dnd` is a robust choice. It's more abstract, using a drag-and-drop backend, but offers extensive control.
* **Manual Draggable Div (Debugging Reference):**
    * **Stack Overflow Example (Conceptual):** [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20926551/recommended-way-of-making-react-component-div-draggable](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20926551/recommended-way-of-making-react-component-div-draggable)
    * **Why it helps:** While you likely want to use a library, reviewing how manual dragging is typically implemented (mousedown, mousemove, mouseup events, updating `transform` CSS property) can help you debug your existing `App.js` logic and identify what might be preventing it from working.

### 2. WebSocket Connection Errors (Problem 2)

WebSocket errors can stem from various points: server implementation, client-side URL, CORS, or server-side logs.

* **FastAPI WebSockets Documentation:**
    * **Official Docs:** [https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/websockets/](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/advanced/websockets/)
    * **Why it helps:** This is the authoritative source for implementing WebSockets in FastAPI. It covers basic setup, sending/receiving messages, handling disconnections, and even security.
    * **Key aspects to review:**
        * Basic `websocket_endpoint` structure (`await websocket.accept()`, `receive_text()`, `send_text()`).
        * Handling `WebSocketDisconnect` exceptions to manage client closures gracefully.
        * Ensuring your WebSocket endpoint path (`/ws`) exactly matches what your React frontend is trying to connect to.
* **FastAPI CORS Middleware:**
    * **Official Docs:** [https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/cors/](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/tutorial/cors/)
    * **Why it helps:** If your React frontend is served from a different origin (port, domain) than your FastAPI backend, CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) can block WebSocket connections.
    * **Key aspects to review:**
        * Adding `CORSMiddleware` to your FastAPI app.
        * Configuring `allow_origins` to include `http://localhost:3000` (or whatever port your React dev server runs on) and `http://localhost:8080` (if your FastAPI server also runs on 8080, which is likely when serving from root).
        * Setting `allow_methods` and `allow_headers` appropriately (e.g., `["*"]` for initial debugging, then narrow down).
* **Debugging Strategies for WebSockets:**
    * **Browser Developer Tools:**
        * **Network Tab:** Filter by "WS" (WebSockets) to see the WebSocket handshake. Look for status codes like `101 Switching Protocols` for success. If you see `404`, `403`, or `500`, it indicates a server-side issue.
        * **Console Tab:** Check for any JavaScript errors related to the WebSocket object or its event handlers (`onopen`, `onmessage`, `onerror`, `onclose`).
    * **FastAPI Server Logs:** Run your FastAPI application with `uvicorn main:app --reload` (or similar) and monitor the console output for any exceptions or errors logged by FastAPI when the WebSocket connection is attempted.
    * **WebSocket Client Tools:** Use a standalone WebSocket client (like Postman, Insomnia, or online WebSocket testers) to connect to `ws://localhost:8080/ws` directly. This helps isolate whether the problem is with your FastAPI backend or your React frontend.

### 3. FastAPI Serving React Build from Root (Current Status / Last Action Performed)

You've correctly identified `app.mount("/", StaticFiles(directory=react_build_dir, html=True), name="react_app")`. This is generally the right approach.

* **FastAPI Static Files Documentation:**
    * **Official Docs:** [https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/reference/staticfiles/](https://fastapi.tiangolo.com/reference/staticfiles/)
    * **Tutorials/Examples:**
        * [How to Serve a Directory of Static Files with FastAPI - bugfactory.io](https://bugfactory.io/articles/how-to-serve-a-directory-of-static-files-with-fastapi/)
        * [Developing a Single Page App with FastAPI and React | TestDriven.io](https://testdriven.io/blog/fastapi-react/)
    * **Why it helps:** These resources detail how `StaticFiles` works, especially the `html=True` parameter which is crucial for single-page applications to serve `index.html` for all unhandled paths (allowing React Router to take over).
    * **Key aspects to review:**
        * Ensure `react_build_dir` points to the *correct* path of your compiled React application (e.g., `../frontend/build` or `../frontend/dist` depending on your React build setup).
        * Verify that `html=True` is set, which instructs FastAPI to serve `index.html` for any path that doesn't resolve to a specific static file.

By leveraging these resources, you should be well-equipped to debug your current issues and refine your implementation towards the desired Cluely AI-like UI.
