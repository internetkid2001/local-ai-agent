## Completed in Session 4.5
1. **✅ Fixed React UI Dragging Functionality**
   - Implemented proper document-level event listeners for dragging
   - Added useCallback for performance optimization
   - Fixed mouse event handling issues

2. **✅ Resolved WebSocket Connection Errors**
   - Added CORS middleware to FastAPI application
   - Reordered route mounting to prevent conflicts
   - Static files now mounted after API routes

3. **✅ Integrated Authentication System**
   - Created `src/agent/api/main.py` with full enterprise auth integration
   - Added protected endpoints for testing authentication
   - Configured startup/shutdown events for proper initialization

## Immediate Next Steps
1. **Performance Optimization & Monitoring**
   - Implement request/response logging middleware
   - Add performance metrics collection
   - Configure health check endpoints with detailed status

2. **Advanced API Gateway Features**
   - Implement rate limiting for API endpoints
   - Add request validation and response schemas
   - Configure API versioning strategy

## Context for Next Session
- **Current State:** Phase 4, UI Enhancement & Authentication Integration completed
- **Architecture:** React frontend with draggable UI + FastAPI backend with enterprise auth
- **Ready for:** Advanced enterprise features and deployment preparation

## Files to Review for Next Session
- `src/agent/enterprise/auth/auth_system.py`
- `src/agent/enterprise/auth/endpoints.py`
- `src/agent/enterprise/auth/jwt_manager.py`
- `src/agent/enterprise/auth/middleware.py`
- `src/agent/enterprise/auth/rbac.py`
- `src/agent/enterprise/auth/tenant_manager.py`
- `src/agent/api/main.py` (to be created)

## Environment State
- All necessary dependencies for FastAPI, JWT, and password hashing are assumed to be installed (e.g., `fastapi`, `uvicorn`, `python-jose[cryptography]`, `passlib[bcrypt]`, `python-multipart`).
