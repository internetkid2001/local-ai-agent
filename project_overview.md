# Local AI Agent Project Overview

## Project Goal

Create a comprehensive local AI agent system that can autonomously manage my computer, files, and tasks through intelligent automation. The agent should run entirely on my local hardware (AMD Ryzen 7 3700X, 31GB RAM, RX 6600 XT) and provide a seamless interface between natural language requests and system operations.

## Core Objectives

### 1. Intelligent AI Model Selection
- Best-in-class model selection: automatically choose the optimal model for each task

- Smart routing based on task requirements, performance needs, and context
- Always use the best available model that meets the task's specific requirements

### 2. System Control via MCP
- Implement Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers for secure system access
- File management: read, write, organize, search, backup files automatically
- System monitoring: track performance, manage processes, automate maintenance
- Desktop automation: screenshot analysis, window management, GUI interaction

### 3. User-Friendly Interface
- **Primary Interface**: Clean, intuitive CLI with rich formatting and colors
- **Web Interface**: Browser-based dashboard for visual task management
- **Voice Interface** (future): Natural speech input for hands-free operation
- **Mobile Interface** (future): Remote control via smartphone app

### 4. Intelligent Task Management
- Natural language to function call translation
- Multi-step task planning and execution
- Error recovery and alternative solution finding
- Learning from user preferences and patterns
